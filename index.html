            <h2>#What are the symptoms of COVID-19 </h2>
            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
                80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
                ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems
                or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with
                fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>

                    Q: What is COVID-19
                </p>
                </p> A: COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
                discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
                before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

                Q: How does COVID-19 spread
            </p>
            <p>
                A: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
                the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
                objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
                can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
                with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
                important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
                who is sick.

                Q: Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

            </p>
            <p>
                A: Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
                transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
                through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
                spread?”

                Q: Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
            </p>
            <p>
                A: The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
                expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
                from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
                possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
                a mild cough and does not feel ill.

            </p>
            <p>
                A: The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
                appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
                be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a
                main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
                COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
                this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
                after using the bathroom and before eating.

            <p>
                A: Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
                countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
                have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
                have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
                situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

            </p>
            <p>
                A: The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

                Q: Should I worry about COVID-19?
            </p>
            <p>
                A: Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
                children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about
                1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite
                normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will
                affect them and their loved ones.

            <p>
                A: While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
                older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
                as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
                diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

                Q: Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?

            </p>
            <p>
                A: No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
                infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.
                Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment
                of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician
                to treat a bacterial infection.

            </p>
            <p>
                A: While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
                comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
                that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not
                recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
                as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several
                ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
                medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon
                as clinical findings are available.

            <p>
                A: No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the
                outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
                related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are

            </p>
            <p>
                A: Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
                coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
                Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
                looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
                a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
                wisely.

            <p>
                A: While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong
                Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
                transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
                produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
                protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.

            <p>
                A: It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
                surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
                suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
                COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
                several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
                surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)

            <p>
                A: Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial
                goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19
                from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to
                different conditions and temperature is also low.

            <p>
                A: The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus
                and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of
                the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most
                commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more
                data become available.
